This is a control-only task. Control agent executes directly—no impl handoff.

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify new tasks include Type field
node packages/cli/dist/bin.js task:add CHAIN-035-task-role-assignment test-verify "Test Verify"
grep "Type" docs/tasks/backlog/CHAIN-035-task-role-assignment/004-test-verify.md
rm docs/tasks/backlog/CHAIN-035-task-role-assignment/004-test-verify.md
```

## Task Type Reference

- **impl** (default): Requires handoff to implementation agent in a fresh session
- **control**: Control agent executes directly (e.g., verification, review, closure tasks)
