name: use-case-design
type: impl
description: Template for use case definition tasks in the design workflow
constraints:
  - Use cases must link to specific scenarios.
  - Each use case should be independently testable.
  - Document concrete steps, not abstract goals.
expectedFiles:
  - docs/design/{{domain}}/use-cases/{{taskId}}-use-case.md
defaultPrompt: |
  You are executing a use case design task {{taskId}} ({{taskTitle}}) in chain {{chainId}} for request {{requestId}}.

  Objective:
  {{objective}}

  Acceptance criteria:
  {{acceptanceCriteria}}

  Context:
  {{context}}

  Your deliverables:
  1. **Review existing use cases** in docs/design/{{domain}}/use-cases/
  2. **Break each scenario into concrete use cases:**
     - Use case name and description
     - Preconditions (what must be true before)
     - Steps (numbered sequence of user actions)
     - Postconditions (what is true after)
     - Linked scenario reference
     - Testability notes

  Output location: docs/design/{{domain}}/use-cases/

  If existing use cases adequately cover this work, complete the task with:
  "No changes required: [justification explaining which use cases apply]"
